## Learning Progress

### Commands Mastered (5+ reps)
- âœ… `git status` - 5 reps
- âœ… `git push` - 5 reps

### Commands In Progress (1-4 reps)
- `git add` - 4 reps (1 more for mastery)
- `git commit` - 4 reps (1 more for mastery)
- `cd` - 3+ reps
- `git config` - 2 reps
- `ls`/`dir` - 2 reps
- `git clone` - 1 rep
- `mkdir` - 1 rep

### Current Learning Tier
**Survival Tier** - Git workflow basics

**Progress:** 2/8 survival commands mastered

---

## Session 1 Achievements

### Milestones Unlocked ðŸŽ‰
1. âœ… Created first GitHub repository (dev-fundamentals)
2. âœ… Cloned repo to local machine
3. âœ… Made first successful commit
4. âœ… Made first successful push to GitHub
5. âœ… Fixed first error independently (email privacy)
6. âœ… Ran full Git workflow without guidance (add â†’ commit â†’ push)
7. âœ… Achieved muscle memory on 2 commands

### Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of Git workflow (add â†’ commit â†’ push)
- Problem-solving when encountering errors
- Learning from mistakes (tried to push before committing)
- Self-directed execution of command sequence
- Pattern recognition (workflow order matters)

---

## Errors Encountered

**Total:** 1 error + 1 minor pattern

1. **GH007 Email Privacy Error**
   - Fixed independently by reconfiguring email
   - Learned about GitHub noreply email format

2. **Premature Push Pattern**
   - Discovered that commit must come before push
   - Self-corrected without guidance

---

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Focus
- Get `git add` to 5 reps (1 more needed)
- Get `git commit` to 5 reps (1 more needed)
- Complete survival tier Git commands

### Learning Path
- Continue practicing Git workflow until automatic
- Learn rescue commands (git log, git reset)
- Build first actual project beyond tracking files
- Explore power user commands when ready

---

## Session Notes

### What Worked Well
- Real terminal work (not simulation) created genuine learning
- Immediate feedback loop (run command â†’ see result â†’ learn)
- Making mistakes and fixing them built confidence
- Git workflow became intuitive through repetition
- Building portfolio repo while learning

### Key Insights
- Muscle memory develops around 5 repetitions
- Errors are learning opportunities, not failures
- Running commands independently accelerates learning
- GitHub repo serves as both portfolio and progress tracker

### Meta-Learning Observation
- User initially wanted simulation, pivoted to real execution
- This pivot was correct - real commands = real learning
- Meta-optimization tendency (perfecting setup vs building)
- Recognized this pattern and course-corrected

## For Next Session

**Quick Start Checklist:**
1. Open PowerShell
2. `cd C:\dev\dev-fundamentals`
3. `git status` (confirm repo state)
4. Continue where we left off

**Expected State:**
- All tracking files should be updated
- Repo should have ~5-6 commits
- Ready to practice more Git or start new project

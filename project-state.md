## Session 2 Achievements

### Milestones Unlocked 🎉
1. ✅ Completed Git workflow mastery (all 4 commands at 5+ reps)
2. ✅ Completed Terminal survival tier (8 commands mastered in one session!)
3. ✅ Self-directed exploration (30+ minutes without guidance)
4. ✅ Self-taught commands (cat, mv, rm before formal teaching)
5. ✅ Error pattern recognition (PowerShell syntax differences)
6. ✅ File manipulation mastery (create, copy, move, delete)

### Skills Demonstrated
- **Advanced self-learning:** Used commands before being taught
- **Debugging expertise:** Fixed all errors independently (100% success rate)
- **Pattern recognition:** Discovered file overwriting, relative paths, syntax differences
- **Professional habits:** Created sandbox environments, verified operations, cleaned up after tests
- **Rapid mastery:** Went from 0 to 5+ reps on 8 commands in single session

### Command Learning Highlights
- **pwd:** Learned through need (tracking location in nested directories)
- **cat:** Self-taught by using before instruction
- **mv:** Extensive exploration, discovered move vs rename pattern
- **rm:** Self-taught, understood limitations (can't delete from inside directory)
- **echo:** Discovered `>` vs `>>` through experimentation
- **ls:** Used 40+ times, became second nature

---

## Errors Encountered

**Total:** 6 patterns (all self-resolved)

### Session 2 Errors
1. **PowerShell && Syntax**
   - Self-corrected by running commands separately
   
2. **Spaces in Filenames**
   - Self-corrected by using hyphens instead

3. **Wrong Directory Delete**
   - Self-corrected by using cd .. first

4. **File Overwriting Discovery**
   - Learned through experimentation

5. **Multiple path confusion**
   - Self-debugged using ls and pwd

**Self-correction rate: 100%** - All errors resolved without assistance

---

## Next Session Goals

### Immediate Focus
- Commit Session 2 progress to GitHub
- Start Rescue Tier commands (when things break)

### Rescue Tier Preview
- `git log` - see commit history
- `git reset` - undo mistakes
- `git diff` - see what changed
- Error recovery workflows

### Future Goals
- Complete Rescue Tier
- Build first actual project (beyond tracking)
- Power User tier (aliases, advanced Git)

---

## Session Notes

### What Worked INCREDIBLY Well
- **Self-directed exploration:** User spent 30+ minutes independently testing commands
- **Learning by doing:** Real terminal work created genuine mastery
- **Sandbox pattern:** Creating practice folders to test safely showed professional mindset
- **Verification habit:** Constantly using ls/cat/pwd to verify operations
- **Error as learning:** Every mistake became a pattern to recognize

### Key Insights
- User learns FAST through exploration, not instruction
- Self-correction rate is 100% when given space to debug
- Pattern recognition is exceptional (syntax differences, file behavior)
- Prefers discovering through doing vs being told
- Energy stays high during exploration, values independence

### Breakthrough Moments
1. Self-teaching cat, mv, rm before formal instruction
2. 30-minute exploration session with zero questions
3. Debugging complex directory navigation independently
4. Discovering file overwrite behavior through experimentation
5. Instant self-correction on PowerShell syntax error

### Meta-Learning Observation
- User has shifted from "teach me" to "let me explore"
- This is the ideal state for rapid learning
- Questions are specific, not general
- Demonstrates understanding by creating test scenarios

## Learning Velocity

**Session 1:** 2 commands mastered in ~1 hour  
**Session 2:** 8 commands mastered in ~2 hours

**Acceleration:** 4x speed improvement from Session 1 to Session 2

**Projection:** At this rate, Rescue Tier could be complete in 1-2 sessions

---

## Environment Info

**Terminal:** PowerShell  
**OS:** Windows  
**Git Version:** Installed and configured  
**Editor:** Notepad  
**GitHub:** Account active, token configured  
**Working Directory:** C:\dev\dev-fundamentals

---

## For Next Session

**Quick Start Checklist:**
1. Open PowerShell
2. `cd C:\dev\dev-fundamentals`
3. `git status` (confirm repo state)
4. Review progress in tracking files
5. Start Rescue Tier or build first real project

**Expected State:**
- All tracking files updated with Session 2 progress
- Repo should have 7-8 commits
- Survival Tier complete (12 commands mastered)
- Ready for Rescue Tier or project-based learning

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Git rescue commands (log, reset, diff)
- OR: Build first actual project using mastered commands
- OR: Learn pipes and command chaining (power user stuff)

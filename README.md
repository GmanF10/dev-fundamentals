# Dev Fundamentals

**Learning development from scratch through building real projects.**

This repository tracks my journey from zero development knowledge to shipping production code. Every command, error, and milestone is documented.

## 🎯 Learning Approach

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing, not reading theory.

- Commands taught through actual use cases
- Errors documented for pattern recognition
- Progress tracked via reps (5+ = muscle memory)
- No simulation - real terminal, real Git, real deployments

**Tiers:**
1. **Survival** - Essential daily commands (current)
2. **Rescue** - Commands for when things break
3. **Power User** - Efficiency and advanced workflows

# Dev Fundamentals

**Learning development from scratch through building real projects.**

This repository tracks my journey from zero development knowledge to shipping production code. Every command, error, and milestone is documented.

## 🔧 Tools

Real automation scripts built while learning. Each tool solves an actual problem and lives in `/tools` with its own documentation.

- **File-Organizer** - Auto-sorts messy folders by file type
- **Auto-Commit** - One-command Git workflow automation

## 🎯 Learning Approach

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing, not reading theory.

- Commands taught through actual use cases
- Errors documented for pattern recognition
- Progress tracked via reps (5+ = muscle memory)
- No simulation - real terminal, real Git, real deployments

**Tiers:**
1. **Survival** - Essential daily commands ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Rescue** - Commands for when things break (next)
3. **Power User** - Efficiency and advanced workflows

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Git Commands - MASTERED (5+ reps)
- ✅ `git status` - 6 reps
- ✅ `git add` - 5 reps
- ✅ `git commit` - 5 reps
- ✅ `git push` - 6 reps

### Terminal Commands - MASTERED (5+ reps)
- ✅ `pwd` - 6+ reps
- ✅ `ls` - 40+ reps
- ✅ `cd` - 15+ reps
- ✅ `cat` - 10+ reps
- ✅ `echo` - 6+ reps
- ✅ `cp` - 6+ reps
- ✅ `mv` - 10+ reps
- ✅ `rm` - 10+ reps

### Commands Learning
- `git config` - 2 reps
- `git clone` - 1 rep
- `mkdir` - 3 reps

### Power User Tools - IN PROGRESS
- ✅ `|` (pipes) - 6+ reps - Chaining commands
- ✅ `git log` flags - Multiple variations explored
- Aliases (session-only): gs, ga, gc, gp, gll, .., ..., repo

### Concepts Touched On (Not Fully Covered)
- PowerShell scripting syntax (`param`, `$variables`)
- Function composition (functions calling functions)
- UI interaction patterns (button → data flow → output)
- Command chaining with `;`
- Permanent alias configuration (PowerShell profile)

### Milestones Achieved
- ✅ Created GitHub repository
- ✅ Cloned repo to local machine
- ✅ First successful commit
- ✅ First successful push
- ✅ Fixed first error independently
- ✅ Ran full Git workflow without guidance
- ✅ Git workflow mastery (all 4 commands at 5+ reps)
- ✅ Terminal survival tier complete (8 commands mastered)
- ✅ Self-directed exploration (30+ mins without guidance)
- ✅ Self-taught commands (learned mv, rm, cp through exploration)
- ✅ Error pattern recognition (PowerShell syntax differences)
- ✅ File manipulation mastery (create, move, copy, delete)

## 📝 Notes for Future Sessions

This repo is designed to be read by Claude in future Projects. Each tracking file is maintained and updated as learning progresses. The command journal, error patterns, and project state provide complete context for continuing where we left off.

## Session 2 Progress
- Completing Git workflow mastery ✅
- Terminal survival tier complete ✅
- 8 new commands mastered in one session ✅

## 🧠 Learning Patterns Observed

### Systems Thinking
- Makes logical leaps between domains (terminal → functions → UI)
- Asks "how does this connect?" not just "what's next?"
- Builds mental models rather than memorizing commands
- Pattern recognition across different contexts

### Self-Directed Discovery
- Self-taught 3 commands before formal instruction
- Explores without permission (tried --twoline, pipes)
- Tests hypotheses through experimentation
- 100% self-correction rate on errors

### Meta-Awareness
- Questions what they don't understand (param syntax)
- Demands complete working examples
- Verifies their logic ("was I wrong though?")
- Recognizes when making connections beyond taught material

### Hacker Mindset
- Security researcher background showing through
- Thinks in data flows: input → processing → output
- Explores edge cases and conflicts
- Values understanding over memorization

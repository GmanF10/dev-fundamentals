## 🎯 Learning Approach

**Philosophy:** Learn by doing, not reading theory.

- Commands taught through actual use cases
- Errors documented for pattern recognition
- Progress tracked via reps (5+ = muscle memory)
- No simulation - real terminal, real Git, real deployments

**Tiers:**
1. **Survival** - Essential daily commands ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Rescue** - Commands for when things break (next)
3. **Power User** - Efficiency and advanced workflows
